Magical Arena two player game description
The Magical Arena is a turn-based battle game designed for two players. Here's a brief description of how the game works:

Game Overview
Objective: The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reducing their health points to zero.

Players: Two players participate in the game, each controlling a character with attributes such as health, strength, and attack.

Gameplay Mechanics
Attributes: Each player has attributes like health (HP), strength, and attack power. These attributes determine how much damage a player can deal and how much they can withstand.

Turn-Based Combat: Players take turns attacking each other. During their turn, a player can choose to attack the opponent, which will reduce the opponent's health based on their attack power and possibly other factors like dice rolls1.

Damage Calculation: The damage dealt to the opponent is calculated based on the attacker's strength and possibly other factors like dice rolls or special abilities.

Winning the Game: The game continues until one player's health points reach zero. The player with remaining health points wins the game.

Example Scenario
Player A has 50 HP, 5 strength, and 10 attack power.

Player B has 100 HP, 10 strength, and 5 attack power.

Turn 1: Player A attacks Player B, causing 20 damage (attack power - strength difference). Player B's health drops to 80 HP2.

Turn 2: Player B attacks Player A, causing 5 damage. Player A's health drops to 45 HP2.

The game continues with players taking turns until one player's health reaches zero
